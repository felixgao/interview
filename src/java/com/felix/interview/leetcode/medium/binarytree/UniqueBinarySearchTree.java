 * F(i, n) = G(i-1) * G(n-i)	1 <= i <= n
 Combining the above two formulas, we obtain the recursive formula for G(n). i.e.

 G(n) = G(0) * G(n-1) + G(1) * G(n-2) + â€¦ + G(n-1) * G(0)


 In English the solution is a consist of
      the number of ways to construct a tree using the first number as root, with everything else on the right subtree
 plus the number of ways to construct a tree using second number as root, with one node as left subtree and rest as right subtree
 plus the number of ways to construct a tree using third number as root, with two nodes as left subtree and rest as right subtree
 plus ....
 plus the number of ways to constrcut a tree using the last number as root, with rest as left subtree and nothing as right subtree
